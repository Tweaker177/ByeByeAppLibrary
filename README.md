# ByeByeAppLibrary

A simple tweak to disable the App Library on the Homescreen.  Works on all iOS versions and devices that have App Libraries.
Also I'm adding features relating to folders, rotation, and other options from FolderController and other 
tweaks that I'm in the process of updating.

Tested on iOS 14-15.7.2, arm64 and arm64e.
